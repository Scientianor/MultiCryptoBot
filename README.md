# MultiCryptoBot
A multifunctional bot that allows you to start automatic mining of any "cryptocurrency" from any Telegram web application.

## What was the purpose of the project?
The project was created to demonstrate how flawed the idea of mining based on web requests is. While millions of people waste their valuable time clicking on hamsters, coins, worm butts, and so on, their families and work are not getting enough attention. The project is based on the idea that cryptocurrency should have a mining mechanism that balances automatic and manual mining or at least does not mislead people, making them realize that automatic algorithms and scripts far exceed their manual efforts. Love yourself, your time, and your families.
